```

### Quick Explanation:

1. **Installation**: Install `Repocate` on your system.
2. **Create**: Run `repocate create` with or without a repository URL.
3. **Clone or Default**: If a repository is provided, it's cloned; otherwise, a default container is created.
4. **Build**: A container is built using the repository's Dockerfile or a default multi-architecture Dockerfile.
5. **Develop**: Enter the container with `repocate enter` and start your development workflow.
