## Usage

After setting up Repocate, you can start using it by cloning repositories into containers. Here's a quick guide:

1. **Create a Development Container:**

   ```sh
   repocate create <repo-url>
   ```

   This command will clone the specified repository into a containerized environment.

2. **Enter the Development Container:**

   ```sh
   repocate enter <repo-url> or <repo_name>
   ```

   Once the container is created, you can enter it using this command.

3. **Stop the Container:**

   ```sh
   repocate stop <repo-url>
   ```

   Stops the running development container.

4. **Rebuild the Container:**

   ```sh
   repocate rebuild <repo-url>
   ```

   Rebuilds the container, applying any updates or changes.

5. **List All Containers:**

   ```sh
   repocate list
   ```

   Lists all Repocate-managed containers with their current status.

6. **Advanced Usage:**

   - **Snapshot:** `repocate snapshot` to create a Git snapshot.
   - **Rollback:** `repocate rollback` to revert to the last known good commit.
   - **Volume Management:** Dynamically create and manage Docker volumes with `repocate volume`.
