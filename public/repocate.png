## Features

- **Containerized Development Environment**: Repocate provides a consistent, reproducible, and isolated development environment inside Docker containers. It includes all necessary dependencies and configurations, ensuring that developers can get started quickly without worrying about local environment setup.

- **Dynamic Port and Volume Management**: Repocate intelligently manages dynamic port assignments and Docker volumes to avoid conflicts, making it easier to run multiple instances simultaneously.

- **Version Control Integration**: The tool integrates seamlessly with Git, allowing automatic versioning and tagging of development containers. This ensures that every significant change is captured and can be easily reverted if necessary.

- **Custom Plugin Support**: Extend the environment with custom Zsh plugins, ensuring that your development shell is tailored to your specific needs.

- **Snapshot and Rollback**: Create Git snapshots before major changes, and easily roll back to previous states in case of issues, ensuring a robust development process.

- **Flexible Configuration**: Repocate allows users to customize their development environment through `.zshrc` and Neovim configuration files, enabling a highly personalized development experience.

## Usage

After setting up Repocate, you can start using it by cloning repositories into containers. Here's a quick guide:

1. **Create a Development Container:**

   ```sh
   repocate create <repo-url>
   ```

   This command will clone the specified repository into a containerized environment.

2. **Enter the Development Container:**

   ```sh
   repocate enter <repo-url> or <repo_name>
   ```

   Once the container is created, you can enter it using this command.

3. **Stop the Container:**

   ```sh
   repocate stop <repo-url>
   ```

   Stops the running development container.

4. **Rebuild the Container:**

   ```sh
   repocate rebuild <repo-url>
   ```

   Rebuilds the container, applying any updates or changes.

5. **List All Containers:**

   ```sh
   repocate list
   ```

   Lists all Repocate-managed containers with their current status.

6. **Advanced Usage:**

   - **Snapshot:** `repocate snapshot` to create a Git snapshot.
   - **Rollback:** `repocate rollback` to revert to the last known good commit.
   - **Volume Management:** Dynamically create and manage Docker volumes with `repocate volume`.
