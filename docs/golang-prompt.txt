:sectnums:
:toc:


== Background

Repocate is designed to streamline the setup and management of development environments by leveraging Docker containers. The tool allows developers to quickly clone repositories, initiate development environments, manage configurations, and monitor system health. By automating these processes, Repocate aims to reduce the time and effort required for environment setup and maintenance, thereby improving developer productivity and consistency across development environments.

== Requirements

The `Repocate` tool must fulfill the following requirements to achieve its intended functionality:

=== Must Have

* `repocate create <repo-url>` command to clone a repository and initialize a Docker container for development.
* `repocate enter <repo-url>` command to allow users to enter an interactive development session within the container.
* `repocate rebuild <repo-url>` command to rebuild the container if the repository or configuration changes.
* `repocate stop <repo-url>` command to stop the running container and free up system resources.
* `repocate list` command to list all managed containers with their statuses and ports.
* `repocate version` command to display the current version of the tool.
* `repocate help` command to provide usage instructions for all commands.

=== Should Have

* Automatic snapshot creation before container rebuild to preserve the current state.
* Detailed error handling and reporting for all commands.
* Integration with popular CI/CD tools for automated environment setup and teardown.

=== Could Have

* Support for multiple container orchestration platforms (e.g., Kubernetes, Docker Swarm).
* Advanced configuration management options, such as environment variable injection and secrets management.
* Plugin system for extending the tool with custom commands or integrations.

=== Won’t Have

* GUI-based management interface in the initial release; the focus will remain on CLI commands.
* Extensive support for non-Docker container platforms in the initial version.

== Method

The `Repocate` tool is designed as a command-line interface (CLI) application built on top of the Docker platform. It facilitates the lifecycle management of development environments using a set of defined commands. The following subsections describe the architecture, command processing flow, and interaction details.

=== Architecture Overview

The architecture of `Repocate` is based on the following key components:

@startuml
actor User as U
package "Repocate CLI" {
    [repocate create]
    [repocate enter]
    [repocate rebuild]
    [repocate stop]
    [repocate list]
    [repocate version]
    [repocate help]
}

package "Docker Daemon" {
    [Docker Container]
    [Docker Volume]
}

U --> [repocate create]
U --> [repocate enter]
U --> [repocate rebuild]
U --> [repocate stop]
U --> [repocate list]
U --> [repocate version]
U --> [repocate help]

[repocate create] --> [Docker Container] : "Git Clone & Initialize"
[repocate enter] --> [Docker Container] : "Start Interactive Shell"
[repocate rebuild] --> [Docker Container] : "Stop, Rebuild, Restart"
[repocate stop] --> [Docker Container] : "Graceful Stop"
[repocate list] --> [Docker Daemon] : "Query Container Status"
[Docker Container] --> [Docker Volume] : "Mount/Unmount Volumes"

----

The core components of the `Repocate` system include:

* **Repocate CLI**: The command-line interface that users interact with, which provides commands for creating, entering, rebuilding, stopping, and listing containers.
* **Docker Daemon**: The background service that manages Docker containers and volumes, which `Repocate` interacts with to perform its functions.
* **Docker Container**: The isolated environment where development takes place, created and managed by `Repocate`.
* **Docker Volume**: Storage associated with the container, where the cloned repository and other necessary files are kept.

=== Command Flow

Each command follows a specific flow to achieve its purpose. The following describes the flow for each key command:

==== repocate create <repo-url>

1. **Input**: User provides the repository URL to be cloned.
2. **Git Clone**: The repository is cloned into a local directory.
3. **Container Initialization**: A new Docker container is created, and the cloned repository is mounted as a volume.
4. **Container Start**: The container is started, and the environment is ready for development.

==== repocate enter <repo-url>

1. **Identify Container**: The container associated with the provided repository URL is identified.
2. **Start Shell Session**: An interactive shell (`/bin/bash`) is started within the container, allowing the user to begin development.

==== repocate rebuild <repo-url>

1. **Stop Container**: The existing container is stopped.
2. **Snapshot (Optional)**: A snapshot of the current state is created (if configured).
3. **Remove Container**: The container is removed from the system.
4. **Rebuild and Start**: A new container is created from the latest repository state and started.

==== repocate stop <repo-url>

1. **Identify Container**: The container associated with the provided repository URL is identified.
2. **Stop Container**: The container is gracefully stopped.
3. **Volume Detachment**: Volumes are unmounted but retained for future use.

==== repocate list

1. **Query Docker**: The Docker daemon is queried for a list of all containers managed by `Repocate`.
2. **Status Reporting**: The status of each container, along with associated ports, is displayed to the user.

==== repocate version

1. **Version Query**: The current version of `Repocate` is retrieved and displayed.

==== repocate help

1. **Help Output**: The built-in help command of the Cobra framework is invoked, providing detailed usage instructions and command descriptions.

=== Interaction with Docker

`Repocate` leverages Docker's API to manage containers and volumes. Each command translates into one or more Docker API calls, which handle the creation, execution, and management of the containers. The system is designed to be stateless, with all state information persisted within Docker itself, reducing the complexity of managing state within `Repocate`.

== Implementation

The implementation of `Repocate` involves setting up the development environment, writing the core logic for each command, ensuring smooth interaction with Docker, and integrating GitHub functionalities to optimize project management. The following steps provide a high-level guide to building out the tool.

=== Step 1: Set Up the Development Environment

1. **Install Go Language**: `Repocate` is implemented in Go, so ensure Go is installed on the development machine.
   - Install Go from the official site: https://golang.org/dl/
2. **Set Up Go Workspace**: Create a workspace for the `Repocate` project.
   - Initialize the module: `go mod init github.com/yourusername/repocate`
3. **Install Required Packages**:
   - Cobra for CLI: `go get -u github.com/spf13/cobra/cobra`
   - Docker SDK for Go: `go get -u github.com/docker/docker/client`
   - GitHub SDK (`go-github`): `go get -u github.com/google/go-github/v41/github`
   - OAuth2 for authentication: `go get -u golang.org/x/oauth2`

=== Step 2: Develop Core Commands

1. **Initialize Cobra CLI**:
   - Create the root command using Cobra.
   - Define the subcommands: `create`, `enter`, `rebuild`, `stop`, `list`, `version`, and `help`.

2. **Implement Command Logic**:
   - **`create` Command**:
     - Implement logic to clone the repository and initialize the Docker container.
     - Use Docker SDK to interact with Docker for container creation.
     - **GitHub Integration**: Optionally check if the repository exists on GitHub using `go-github` before cloning.
   - **`enter` Command**:
     - Implement logic to attach an interactive shell session to the running container.
   - **`rebuild` Command**:
     - Implement logic to stop, remove, and rebuild the container.
   - **`stop` Command**:
     - Implement logic to gracefully stop the running container.
   - **`list` Command**:
     - Implement logic to query Docker for a list of managed containers and display their statuses.
   - **`version` Command**:
     - Implement logic to display the current version of `Repocate`.
   - **`help` Command**:
     - Use Cobra’s built-in help functionality to provide usage information.

3. **GitHub API Integration**:
   - **Repository Management**:
     - Use `go-github` to programmatically manage repositories, such as creating or archiving repositories directly from `Repocate`.
   - **Issue Tracking**:
     - Add a feature to manage GitHub issues within the CLI, allowing users to list, create, or close issues without leaving their development environment.
   - **Pull Request Management**:
     - Implement commands to create, list, and merge pull requests, making it easier to manage development workflows.

4. **Error Handling**:
   - Implement comprehensive error handling for each command to ensure clear and actionable error messages.

=== Step 3: Testing

   - Write unit tests for each command using Go’s testing framework.
   - Mock Docker interactions to isolate and test command logic.
   - Mock GitHub API interactions using `go-github` to test GitHub-related features.

2. **Integration Testing**:
   - Set up a test environment with Docker to run integration tests.
   - Test the full lifecycle of a container using `create`, `enter`, `rebuild`, and `stop` commands.
   - Perform integration tests with a test GitHub repository to ensure GitHub-related commands function as expected.
   - Use real Docker containers and GitHub repositories in a controlled environment to validate the end-to-end functionality of `Repocate`.

3. **Continuous Integration**:
   - Integrate the tests into a CI pipeline (e.g., using GitHub Actions) to automate the testing process.
   - Ensure that the CI pipeline runs unit and integration tests on each commit and pull request.
   - Set up automated builds and deployments based on the CI pipeline results.

=== Step 4: Documentation

1. **Command Documentation**:
